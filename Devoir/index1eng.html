                     I mix and layer shades to evoke emotions, exploring how they interact and change. 
                     For me, it's about finding harmony in the chaos, just like in life."</p>

    <h2> <span class="star">☆</span> MY CAREER :</h2>
    <div class="image-text">      
        
         <img class="artist border" src="img/arteest.webp" alt="ME">
         <p class="marge"> "I was born in a small German town called Bertholt.
            My childhood was extremely difficult until the day I was contacted by the prestigious Keirnstein II School of Visual Arts.
            This allowed me to express myself through my art and immerse myself in all kinds of sources of inspiration.
            I also underwent very intense military training because my hometown was made up of people who believed in conspiracy theories. This caused me to lose my hair, and it was at that moment that I realized beauty is about seeing beyond appearances.
            When my village was attacked, I watched my fellow cadets die right before my eyes. This event not only traumatized me but also inspired me greatly.
            My career truly took off the day my grandfather died in forced labor in the fields, and I was promoted to corporal chief of the exploration battalion."</p>

    <h2> <span class="star">☆ </span> MY PROCESS :</h2> 
 
    <div>  
    <div class="image-text"> 
             <img class="artist border" src="img/artistt.PNG" alt="ME AGAIN">
             <p class="marge"> "I create my works whenever I feel the urge.
                I don’t follow any particular artistic process mechanically.
                My professor, Kruger Jager, helped me a lot in shaping my production method, whether on canvas or digitally.
                My art is inspired by the traumas I endured during the trench warfare between the Eldians and the Marleyans. The hope that one day we would all be free from this burden and these walls led me to join a clandestine club where my comrades, survivors of the war, would carve stylish symbols on their chests with knives, and our leader wore a strange old sage costume while sitting at a table with dice. The many war crimes we committed are the primary source of inspiration for my work. And to be honest, I love Dungeons and Dragons."</p> </div>
